    <section class="main-section" id="A"><header>A</header>
      <p>The first letter, associated with the first number, A is a powerful initial to give your baby. It acts as a strong indicator of her future leadership ability, and will help her with planning and innovation.
  
  People with the initial A project self-confidence, ambition, initiative, originality, strength and willpower. This letter can therefore bring your baby great energy and creativity.
  
  On the negative side, those with the initial A can sometimes be discouraging of others.</p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Anthony</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="B"><header>B</header>
      <p>This letter has an aura of serenity and contentment. With the initial B, your baby will have a spiritual leaning, which may bring him great happiness in life.
  
  As your baby grows, he's likely to be family-oriented, with a generous soul and a warm heart. He'll love nature and animals too.
  
  This emotional streak cuts both ways though, as some people influenced by B can take things too personally.</p> <br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Bebilla</li>
        </ul>
      
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="C"><header>C</header>
      <p>Those motivated by the letter C are impulsive and joyful people. Giving your baby this initial means she'll thrive on movement and change, and always seek out and appreciate new experiences.
  
  Driven by intuition, people with the initial C can take on too much at once, and may not always finish what they start.</p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Christian</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="D"><header>D</header>
      <p>The letter D signifies balance and harmony. Your baby will be practical, self-disciplined and persistent in striving for his goals if influenced by this initial.
  
  Your baby may make a great leader with the initial D. He'll cope well with responsibility, and will enjoy taking on grand challenges.
  
  However, some people influenced by this letter are in danger of becoming too proud or stubborn as a result of their efforts.</p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Daniel</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="E"><header>E</header>
      <p>The letter E conveys joyfulness, generosity and a great sense of humour. If you give your baby this initial, she'll be chatty and free-spirited. She's also likely to be highly active, and enjoy the finer things in life.
  
  The downside of this letter is that your baby may get bored quickly. So as she grows, she may find it difficult to start projects she doesnâ€™t enjoy.</p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Emma</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="F"><header>F</header>
      <p>If your baby's name begins with the letter F, he'll have a strong desire to help others. Tender and loving with a calm temperament, people with this initial make great peacekeepers who can resolve any conflict.
  
  This letter brings a willingness to work hard at even the most humble tasks. However, F can also bring with it little insecurities. This means you may need to remind your baby just how important he is as he gets older.</p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Fedrick</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="G"><header>G</header>
      <p>The letter G conveys great stability. If your baby's influenced by it, she'll be self-sufficient, and will look inwards to learn more about herself. This will allow her to make the best of her natural talents.
  
  People with the initial G are satisfied with doing good work for its own sake, rather than demanding great rewards. However, this independence also means that they're sometimes stubborn and impatient with others.</p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Gerry</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="H"><header>H</header>
      <p>People associated with the letter H are always on the go. With a strong inner drive, your baby will gain great self-control, stamina and endurance from this initial. This will help him to achieve his goals.
  
  In addition, H often brings creative skills. So you may want to encourage your baby's artistic pursuits if you choose this letter.
  
  The negative aspect of this letter is that it can make people too honest, sometimes to the point of being blunt.</p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Harry</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="I"><header>I</header>
      <p>A name beginning with I will inspire your baby to be humane, generous and enthusiastic. She'll often put others' needs before her own, meaning she'll make a good counsellor, psychologist or teacher.
  
  However, the classic artistic temperament that comes with this initial can also create a mysterious and moody appearance. People with this letter may even come across as vain or proud at times.</p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Iin</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="J"><header>J</header>
      <p>Above all, the letter J is associated with kindness. If your baby's name starts with J, he's sure to be family-oriented, and he may seek a career that fits around his personal commitments.
  
  This initial also brings creativity, intelligence and exuberance, which will help your baby to succeed.
  
  However, people influenced by J can be so preoccupied with caring for their family that they lose touch with the wider world. As your child grows, he may need reminding that friends and colleagues need his attention, too.</p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Jeff</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="K"><header>K</header>
      <p>
        This letter projects energy, originality, authority and leadership qualities. Your baby is sure to have great spiritual and physical energy with this initial, which she'll use to help others.
  
  Using this initial for your baby will make her capable of great achievements. But she'll need your guidance to help her use her energy wisely, or she may end up procrastinating.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Kevin</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="L"><header>L</header>
      <p>
        This letter radiates wisdom, dedication and imagination. Your baby is destined to complete everything he sets out to do, and to help those less fortunate than him.
  
  Choosing a name beginning with L also means your baby will relish friendship, home and family life. However, the great knowledge and understanding of the world projected by this initial can lead its bearer to become quick-tempered when dealing with opposing views.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Lena</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="M"><header>M</header>
      <p>
        M is a happy, optimistic letter with great creative vibrations. It will influence your baby to be cheerful, and to have a great love of home and hearth.
  
  As your baby grows, the letter M means she'll be proud to stand up for those she loves. She'll also act as a strong advocate for the causes she supports.
  
  The flip-side is that M can bring volatility. This means that people with this initial have strong emotions, which can make them prone to jealousy.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Marc</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="N"><header>N</header>
      <p>
        The letter N is associated with intelligence and imagination, as well as the determination to put plans into practice.
  
  Giving your baby this initial means he'll grow up to take great pride in overcoming obstacles, and will successfully find his own path in life. This may make him intriguing to others!
  
  However, when people motivated by N encounter a problem they can't overcome, they tend to become moody and introspective.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Neil</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="O"><header>O</header>
      <p>
        The letter O has strong spiritual vibrations, which can bring great insight. Giving your baby this initial will power her by an inner light. She'll grow up fair, just and brave.
  
  Your baby is also sure to make an excellent mediator, and have the skills to easily achieve her professional aims.
  
  People with this initial can become unrealistic, dreamy and emotional, though, so they need a little help to keep their feet on the ground.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Obi</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="P"><header>P</header>
      <p>
        The letter P will bring your baby a fascinating combination of common sense, order and reason, and a hearty dose of creative talent too. He'll love to learn all he can, and will happily express what he's learned to others.
  
  Your baby will enjoy success, and will like to surround himself with gifted or influential individuals who can help him understand the world.
  
  However, people whose name begins with P are caught between creativity and the desire for order. This can make them contradict themselves sometimes.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Pauline</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Q"><header>Q</header>
      <p>
        This is a letter that projects confidence, persistence and calm. If you give your baby the initial Q, she'll probably grow to be intense and quick-witted, with great intuition.
  
  With Q leading your baby, she's destined to become a leader rather than a follower. She'll often take an interest in the unusual side of life, and will occupy her mind with the strange and cryptic.
  
  People with the initial Q have a great confidence that propels them to succeed. But it may take a bit more effort for them to consider the impact their actions can have on others.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Qei</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="R"><header>R</header>
      <p>
        The letter R represents a soft, kind and gentle spirit. If your baby has this initial, he'll have a positive, idealistic outlook on life, and will love helping others.
  
  Your baby may well become a bohemian eccentric who loves all people, and goes to great lengths to help them. His honest and trusting nature will often win him respect from those around him.
  
  However, people with the initial R can come across as airy-fairy or superficial at times.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Ruby</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="S"><header>S</header>
      <p>
        The letter S is associated with a strong and dedicated spirit. Giving your baby this initial will project an ability to weather any hardship and make it through difficult times. She'll also have the power to realise her dreams and build her ideal future.
  
  The downside of such an intense spirit is that it can cause people to be quick-tempered when their life is out of balance.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Sam</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="T"><header>T</header>
      <p>
        This letter conveys great patience, tolerance and kindness. Those touched by the letter T have excellent leadership qualities, and may be seen as a dominant force in their workplaces or friendship groups.
  
  Giving your baby this initial will mean he's likely to share his knowledge and possessions freely with those he leads.
  
  People influenced by T may need plenty of support from others, or they risk becoming emotional, nervous or apathetic.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Tim</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="U"><header>U</header>
      <p>
        The letter U will bring a magical, mystical quality to your baby. She'll probably be talented and lucky, but she'll often find herself torn between duty and desire too.
  
  If your baby can overcome the craving for material wealth this letter may spell for her future, she'll seize opportunities and achieve great success.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Umma</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="V"><header>V</header>
      <p>
        If you choose V as your baby's first initial, he'll be creative, hard-working and loyal. Passionate and enthusiastic, those influenced by this letter often grow restless if they don't have the opportunity to move and explore.
  
  Your baby's destined to enjoy the finer things in life with this initial. Some people influenced by V find it hard to manage their money, though.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Vinston</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="W"><header>W</header>
      <p>
        This letter projects great willpower, strength and enthusiasm. If your baby bears this initial, she'll often be seen as charming and kind. This will help her get along with a wide variety of people.
  
  Curious by nature, your baby will enjoy lots of energy if she has the initial W. She'll delight in adventure and risk-taking, and may be well suited to a job in the travel industry.
  
  However, this initial brings such passion to some people that it can lead them to get carried away and reveal an aggressive streak.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>William</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="X"><header>X</header>
      <p>
        Those rare souls with the initial X are constantly striving to better themselves, seeking perfection and balance in all things.
  
  With the letter X, your baby will have a lively nature and show exceptional bravery. He'll also be happy to embrace change in his search for harmony.
  
  However, people with this letter don't always think things through, and can become negative when things don't go according to plan.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Xan</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Y"><header>Y</header>
      <p>
        This initial brings great determination, and both physical and spiritual energy to its bearer. If your baby's influenced by Y, she'll be highly analytical and intelligent, with the ability to quickly find solutions to her problems.
  
  It's likely that your baby will also grow up with a burning desire to succeed and to shine in her chosen profession.
  
  People influenced by Y may waste a lot of energy over-thinking things, though. This can cause them to appear vague or confused to those who don't have their level of insight.
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Yoshua</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Z"><header>Z</header>
      <p>
        The letter Z brings determination, persistence and fearlessness. With this initial, your baby will always finish what he starts, and he'll be highly organised and methodical.
  
  Intuitive and fair-minded, your baby will make an excellent leader. However, some with this initial can let their ambition run away with them, often at the cost of their personal relationships.
  
      </p><br>
      <code>Example:</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Zaki</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
